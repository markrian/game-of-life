 - Add options:
  - colours
  - rotation
 - Add function to get cell from mouse position, with callback support: getCellFromPoint
 - Add smooth animation transitions from generation to generation
 - Make canvas the only drawing method
 - Add classes property to GameOfLife class so that the underlying classes can be accessed for custom work
 - Add noConflict method
 - Add ability to adjust the centre of where to draw the field. This way, could track a spaceship, or gliders!
 - Performance improvements:
  - Add function getVisibleCells. With this, can draw only those cells which are visible in the canvas. Would probably benefit by calculating the transformation matrix to get out-of-field cells (i.e., wrapped cells) that would get drawn
  - Possibly useful methods: drawRegion
  - getCellsFromBounds
  - isCellInBounds
  - Where bounds are two points, which define a rectangular region
